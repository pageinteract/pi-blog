# Cursor Project Rules – Main

## Project Context
- This repository is a full-stack blog platform based on the official Strapi LaunchPad template, using **Strapi (CMS/back-end)** and **Next.js (front-end)**.
- All major AI/code suggestions must prioritize clean separation between front-end and CMS logic.
- The project is to be progressively enhanced for the main blog at https://pageinteract.com/blog, prioritizing performance, SEO, accessibility, and best practices.

## Routing & Language
- **Default homepage is `/`** (not `/en` or any other locale-based path).
- There should be **no locale division or locale-based redirection**—disable or remove all i18n routing unless explicitly working on multi-language support.

## UI/UX
- UI components and design patterns must be based on **https://ui.shadcn.com/** (ShadCN UI).
- Favor clean, modern, highly accessible, and responsive patterns.
- Ensure global styles and primitives are consistent throughout the project.

## Modularity & Type Safety
- Use strict TypeScript for all new code (front-end and back-end typings).
- All feature logic should be modularized for maintainability.
- Strive for clear, self-documenting code and concise inline comments where non-obvious.

## Integration
- Next.js must consume data exclusively via Strapi APIs (REST or GraphQL).
- All API endpoints and fetch logic must handle server and client-side rendering securely.
