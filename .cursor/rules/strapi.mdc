# Cursor Rules – Strapi Backend

## Internationalization
- **Disable all locale support and middleware** (`i18n`) unless a task requires i18n for future expansion.
- All API endpoints and content-types default to a single language.

## Content Models
- Use Strapi's Content-Types for Articles, Pages, and Global config.
- All content models should have strong type definitions, clear validation, and concise relationships.
- Optimize collections for blog content—fields must support markdown or rich text.

## API & Permissions
- Expose **read-only** API endpoints for blog, unless securely authenticated write access is required.
- Sanitize all responses and enable only necessary permissions in public roles.
- REST API should be preferred unless explicit need for GraphQL.

## SEO & Metadata
- All content-types should include SEO metadata fields (e.g., title, description, Open Graph fields).
- Ensure Strapi’s SEO plugin (or custom fields) are populated and consistent.

## Media Handling
- Serve media assets using Strapi's built-in Media Library. Optimize images for web (use plugins for optimization if needed).
- Set max size policies and automate clean-up of unused assets.

## Extensibility
- All plugin or middleware customization must be clearly documented in code and in this rules file.
- Favor upgrades and compatibility with latest Strapi versions (v5.x+).
