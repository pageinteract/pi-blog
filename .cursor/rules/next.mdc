# Cursor Rules – Next.js Front-end

## Routing
- Homepage **must be `/`**, not `/en` or locale-based. Disable/remove `i18n` from `next.config.js`.
- `/blog` should list blog posts; `/blog/[slug]` should display individual articles.
- Implement canonical URLs for SEO, ensuring `/blog` and `/blog/[slug]` resolve properly.
- No locale or language-prefixed URLs.

## ShadCN UI Integration
- All components and layouts should use **shadcn/ui** primitives.
- Prefer composable, themeable, and accessible patterns—favor server components where possible.
- Customize ShadCN themes and tokens to match pageinteract.com branding.
- Ensure dark/light mode support and mobile responsiveness.
- Avoid using third-party UI libraries unless ShadCN cannot support the need.

## Data Fetching
- Use **TypeScript** with full types for Strapi data structures.
- Favor SSG/ISR (Static Site Generation/Incremental Static Regeneration) for blog routes.
- Sanitize and validate all external data.

## Structure & Quality
- Co-locate components, hooks, and tests with feature logic (e.g., `/components`, `/hooks`, `/lib`).
- Use modern Next.js app directory features if project supports.
- Test UI/UX in Chrome and Firefox for A11y.
- All navigation, CTAs, and forms should be keyboard accessible.

## Performance & SEO
- Apply lazy load, code splitting, and optimized images.
- Use Next.js SEO helpers and ensure meta tags/parsing for blog posts is robust.
